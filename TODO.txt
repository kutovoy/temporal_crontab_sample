optional:

1. separate worker into a separate class

long term:

1. fully implement deterministic key concept: implement fully deterministic model for CronTabWorkflow by let's say passing created/updated crontab content via a signal into CronTabWorkflow so it can recover it's state
2. fully support distributed key concept: support some code version control system and integrate via some hooks - currently this sample is not distributed - sample expects that crontab folder exists on the host with the worker executing workflows
